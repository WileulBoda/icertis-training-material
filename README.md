# icertis-training-material
### In this repository I upload training material and exam dumps for Icertis exams. My goal is to help you guys prepare for your exam and pass it with flying colours. Have fun studying and good luck!!

### For each exam you have to answer 50 multiple choice questions in 60 minutes. You have 2 attempts. As far as I know the second attempt has the same questions as the first one. You can also view your results of your first attempt before taking the second one.
